<h1 align="center">Modern Login Page</h1>

## Description
> This website features a modern login and registration interface. Upon arrival, the user is presented with two forms: one for registering and one for logging in. Both forms allow access to the platform using a social account (Google, Facebook, GitHub or LinkedIn) or via email and password.

> In addition, there is a toggle panel on the right side of the screen that allows switching between the login and registration form in an animated manner. This page also offers an option to recover the password in case of forgetting it. In short, it is a visually appealing and easy-to-use page for managing access to a platform.
